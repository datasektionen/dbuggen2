New dbuggen, even more serious.

## Boring computer nerd stuff

To run this locally, either run via the Dockerfile which *should* set up everything for you, or run it using Go yourself.

First run
```shell
go mod download
```

and then run
```shell
go run main.go
```

and then find your way to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
